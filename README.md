Order ID: { order_id }  
Purchase Date: { purchase_date }  
Product Name: { product_name }  
Total Price: ${ total_price }  
Payment Method: { payment_method }  

This email was sent to { recipient_email }.

Common Shortcodes:

{ account_id }: Customerâ€™s account ID

{ order_id }: Order ID

{ purchase_date }: Purchase date

{ product_name }: Product name

{ total_price }: Total purchase amount

{ payment_method }: Payment method used

{ recipient_email }: Recipientâ€™s email address
